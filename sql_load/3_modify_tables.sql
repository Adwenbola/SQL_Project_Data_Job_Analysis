Create a unified query that categorizes job postings into two groups:
those with salary information (salary_year_avg or salary_hour_avg is not null) 
and those without it. Each job posting should be listed with its job_id, job_title, 
and an indicator of whether salary information is provided.

Hint
Use UNION ALL to merge results from two separate queries.
For the first query, filter job postings where either salary field is 
not null to identify postings with salary information.
For the second query, filter for postings where both salary fields are 
null to identify postings without salary information.
Include a custom field to indicate the presence or absence of salary information in the output.
When categorizing data, you can create a custom label directly in your query using string literals,
such as 'With Salary Info' or 'Without Salary Info'. These literals are manually inserted
values that indicate specific characteristics of each record. An example of this is as 
a new column in the query that doesnâ€™t have salary information, put: 'Without Salary Info' 
AS salary_info. As the last column in the SELECT statement.
